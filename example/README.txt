This directory contains a sample source file and accompanying CMakeLists.txt configuration file. 

Those using LibMIA manually can ignore the CMakeLists.txt file.

For those using the CMake build tool, the CMakeLists.txt file is meant to get you started in using LibMIA in combination with CMake. It assumes you've used CMake to install LibMIA. Please consult http://libmia.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Installation for more information.
