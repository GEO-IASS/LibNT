This directory contains a sample source file and accompanying CMakeLists.txt configuration file. 

Those using LibMIA manually can ignore the CMakeLists.txt file.

For those using the CMake build tool, the CMakeLists.txt file is meant to get you started in using LibMIA in combination with CMake. Please consult http://libmia.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Installation for more information. (NOTE Wiki went down, so documentation is now lost, will update as soon as I can)
