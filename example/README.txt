This directory contains a sample source file and accompanying CMakeLists.txt configuration file. 

Those using LibMIA manually can ignore the CMakeLists.txt file and just follow the instructions of the root README.txt file. However, even those pursuing this option may find some of the build options in the CMakeLists.txt file useful.

For those using the CMake build tool, the CMakeLists.txt file is meant to get you started in using LibMIA in combination with CMake.
